## Weapons package, standard issue

*As an adventurer of the e-wilds, my survival depends on my weapons. I mean, I need to setup my Mac properly.*

Freshly unpacked, or newly reinstalled, a Mac needs quite a lot of tuning before it is really ready to respond to a generalist developer's needs. From Web development tools to Android, so many layers are required, essential, or at least pretty useful that I can't keep all of it in mind. Here I shall attempt to document some of the steps I usually take, for my own benefit and for others.

## Battlecruiser Operational

I usually setup the Mac with an encrypted hard disk, and as many user accounts as appropriate.

### Basics

I used to run `MacPorts`, but `Homebrew` now has a clear multi-user procedure and many packages are more up-to-date (for obvious reasons), making it my current choice. I prefer using the standard Terminal, Vim, rbenv, nvm and pip.

### Web Dev

Nvm, npm, docker (a choice which precludes Virtualbox at the moment), espresso (a MacRabbits tool), Brackets.

### Embedded

Arduino and some libraries.

### Android

### iOS && Swift Server Side
