### Bill of Materials

- Arduino Uno (and later, Nano V3 AVR)
- CC3000 from Adafruit (now discontinued)

###
I first read the [WiFi example](https://learn.adafruit.com/wifi-weather-station-arduino-cc3000/connecting-the-cc3000-breakout-board)
from adafruit's weather station, which is pretty close to my setup.

As it failed to work properly after I made my own version, I checked out the examples, and I ran buildtest. It turned out the baudrate was too high, so I reduced it to 9600 and things started working.

I use the Nano's SPI pins (D11, D12 and D13), plus D10 for the CS Pin, and I've moved the IRQ Pin to Pin D2, since I already use D3 for my DHT sensor. This works because both D2 and D3 are external interrupt capable pins on the Nano (and the Uno).

Now I have a working weather station, and I have a web server. However, I don't have both of them operating at the same time yet, because my weather station runs an external screen. Writing the code is the next step, and that's going to be fun!
